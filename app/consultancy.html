      <div class="mb-2">
        After for 5 years working in traditional art galleries in France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, I grew frustrated with how little time we would dedicate to the artists we represented. If a gallery has more than 12 artists, which is actually a low number, and if solo exhibitions are a month long, that means that each artist has the full attention of his or her gallery only once a year! 
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2">
        At the same time, other creators, for example musicians, have found ways to leverage modern digital techniques to grow their audience and have successful careers, which, as a millennial and a heavy user of platforms such as Instagram and Youtube I relate to very much.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2">
        That's why I decided that I could combine both my work experience in galleries and my digital know-how to offer artists all the attention they deserve and give them a better chance at making a living of their art.
