        The Artist Business Tool Subscription
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-3">
        Organizing your career as an artist can be overwhelming when it comes to selling, getting your works into exhibitions, or networking.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-3">
        If you do not have an art gallery to do this work for you, you need to be your own gallery.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-3">
        The Artist Business Tool Subscription helps you with sales and network research. The goal is to help you contact people from the art world (advisors, collectors, designers, curators), in order to sell your works, or to exhibit your works. 
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-4">
        The subscription gives you access to a private Facebook Group where you will find dedicated support, and where members discuss business matters, sales, and networking.
      </div>
      <div class="artist-club citation mb-2 mb-4">
        Ready to bring you career to the next level? <a href="https://manage.campaignzee.com/HEcQIz7711" target="_blank">Sign up here!</a>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-3">
        If you want to get as much as possible from this subscription, try to dedicate half an hour a day to put into action the plan I set out in the weekly email.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-3">
        You do not need to have organized all your archives before starting, but do have a portfolio ready.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-1">
        Your portfolio should be composed of:
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-3">
        Part I - An artist statement (10 lines) </br>
        Part II - 10 recent works </br>
        Part III - Your CV which should include recent exhibitions </br>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-3">
       Have two versions of the pdf:
       <ul>
         <li>
           One with prices, to address to advisors, collectors, designers. 
         </li>
         <li>
           One without prices, to send to curators. 
         </li>
       </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2 mb-3">
        Once you have your portfolio ready with the above elements, in the form of a PDF document, you are all ready to go. 
      </div>
